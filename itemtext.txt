BMF was playing around with parts of my site and wondered what text was in that
chest. So, after showing him...

BMF: "Huh. I wonder if they ran out of space and just overwrote the Bow's
      message."
Xkeeper: "Hm, maybe..."


Sure enough... here's a text dump of the ROM, and a list of items in chests:
		
0x00    => "Power Bracelet",
0x01    => "Mirror Shield",
0x02    => "Bow",
0x03    => "Hookshot",
0x04    => "Fire Rod",
0x05    => "Pegasus Boots",
0x06    => "Ocarina",

You found the   
Power Bracelet! 
At last, you can
pick up pots and
stones!

You got your    
Shield back!    
You can use it  
to flip enemies!

Ahhh... Yess... 
That dust was so
refreshing...   
For that, I'll  
tell you a hint!
Use a Bomb in a 
place where the 
sand swallows   
you... There is 
a treat on the  
other side of   
the wall... Bye!

You've got the  
Hook Shot!  Its 
chain stretches 
long when you   
use it!

You've got the  
Magic Rod!  Now 
you can burn    
things! Burn it!
Burn, baby burn!

You've got the  
Pegasus Boots!  
If you hold down
the Button, you 
can dash!

You've got the  
Ocarina!  You   
should learn to 
play many songs!
